# Botfunder

Botfunder is a funding entity to generate funds for the Astoria High School
[Riverbots](https://riverbots.org).

## The Website

There are two primary components to the website:

1. The general outline of the project and its linkages to primary mentor
   [BJ Black](https://wjblack.com), and
2. The demo of the very-similar "system health" application for Switch/Switch 2
   that is being proposed for the [Nintendo](https://nintendo.com) store.

## HTML vs Godot

The general outline of the project is mostly a bog-standard [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
website that has:

1. A general overview of the project,
2. Linkages to BJ and the Riverbots, and
3. A "donate now" link :-)

The "game" that demos the style and content of the proposed app for Switch that
includes:

1. The splash screen, visual style, and sprites of the app.
2. Information exposed by the browser about the running browser.
   a. Browser type and version.
   b. Local and remote IP address info.
   c. Network performance information such as ping times.
